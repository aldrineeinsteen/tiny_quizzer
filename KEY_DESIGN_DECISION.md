# Key Design Decision: 

# Monorepo Policy

## Decision

After careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of using a monorepo, the decision has been made to use a monorepo for the Tiny Quizzer project. The frontend, backend, and other components of the application will be stored in a single repository.

## Rationale

The decision to use a monorepo was based on the following factors:

1.  Simplified dependency management and synchronization between frontend and backend components.
2.  Streamlined collaboration and communication within the development team.
3.  Easier setup and maintenance of a single CI/CD pipeline for the entire application.

While recognizing the potential drawbacks of using a monorepo, such as scalability and access control challenges, the benefits of a monorepo align with the current needs and goals of the Tiny Quizzer project. As the project evolves, the monorepo policy can be re-evaluated and adjusted as needed.
